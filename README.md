# ruby-template


This project is Microverse Ruby Capstone project. I have built a bot that posts a tweet at 12pm every day. I have selected three pages that interest me and my bot will retweet one of the recent 10 posts out of these three pages. It will also check its memory to confirm that it does not retweet the same tweet.
